# Vue Jobs

A Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue.js, allowing users to explore, add, edit, delete, and manage job listings. This project demonstrates CRUD operations seamlessly integrated with a JSON server using Axios.

## Important Note:

The app relies on **JSON-Server** for its backend. To experience the complete functionality (viewing, adding, editing, and deleting jobs), you must run the app locally by following the steps in the **Installation** section below. The deployed version does not include data due to JSON-Server limitations.

## Features:

- **Add, Edit, Delete Jobs:** Manage job listings with intuitive forms and validation.
- **View Jobs:** Browse and search job listings efficiently.
- **Responsive Design:** A visually appealing, mobile-friendly interface built with TailwindCSS.
- **User Feedback:** Toast notifications for user actions, providing a smooth experience.
- **Loading Indicators:** Enhanced user experience with loading spinners for asynchronous operations.

## Technologies Used:

- **Vue.js:** Framework for building the app's user interface.
- **Vue-Router:** For SPA routing.
- **Axios:** For handling HTTP requests.
- **JSON-Server:** A lightweight backend for managing job data.
- **Vue-Toastification:** For user-friendly toast notifications.
- **Vue-Spinner:** For dynamic loading indicators.
- **PrimeIcons:** Icons for UI enhancement.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite:** For fast build and development processes.
